# Giphy Search Engine

## Overview

This project is a Giphy search engine.  Open the [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/Giphy).  Click on a button to begin a search. It will choose the top 10 images.  Click on the image and it plays.  Click on the image again, and it stops.  Add your own category by entering your desired category and clicking on the add category button on the right hand side.  Then search with that category.  

### Problem 
This problem is a search engine where users can search for a term, and the search engine will return the top 10 images (in gif format - hance the name Giphy).  When the page opens, the user is presented with a predefined number of categories from which they can search.  The user can add his/her own categories to search on as well.  

### How I solved it
This game uses only frontend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. I used HTML to create the structure of the page.  I used CSS to style the page.  We use JQuery to edit and append the elements of the DOM.  We used jQuery's AJAX method to access the Giphy API, and return the results.
